# Purpose

This document summarizes the analyses conducted on the Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project pilot data.
The data are stored and shared at <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/444>.

# Set-up

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load databraryapi package from github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi
if (!require(databraryapi)) {
  devtools::install_github("PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi")
  library(databraryapi)
}
```

The Databrary volume is 444, so we assign this to a variable: `r play_vol_id <- 444` so that we can index it later.

We need to log in to Databrary to have access to these data.

```{r}

```
