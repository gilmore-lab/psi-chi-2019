These files support work by the undergraduate students in the Gilmore lab related to the 2019 Psi Chi ($\Psi\chi$) event.

## Contents

- `play-plot-summary.Rmd` is a working document that summarizes some of the pilot data from the PLAY project. 
To render it anew, run `rmarkdown::render('play-project-summary.Rmd', params=list(db_account = 'youremail@yourdomain.com'))`, where `youremail@yourdomain.com` is your valid Databrary user ID (email address).
Note that the code will fail unless the user has a valid account on Databrary.
