- `play-plot-summary.Rmd` is a working document that summarizes some of the pilot data from the PLAY project. To render it anew, run `rmarkdown::render('play-project-summary.Rmd')`. Note that the code will fail unless the user has a valid account on Databrary, as the data are pulled from Databrary.
- `play-project-summary.html` is an HTML format produced by the Rmd code. You may view it at <https://gilmore-lab.github.io/psi-chi-2019/play-project-summary.html>.
