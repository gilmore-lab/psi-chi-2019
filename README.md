## Contents

- `play-plot-summary.Rmd` is a working document that summarizes some of the pilot data from the PLAY project. 
To render it anew, run `rmarkdown::render('play-project-summary.Rmd', params=list(db_account = 'youremail@yourdomain.com'))`, where `youremail@yourdomain.com` is your valid Databrary user ID (email address).
Note that the code will fail unless the user has a valid account on Databrary.
- `play-project-summary.html` is an HTML format report produced by the Rmd code. You may view it at <https://gilmore-lab.github.io/psi-chi-2019/play-pilot-summary.html>.
